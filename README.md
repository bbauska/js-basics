Examples of JavaScript Programmes for Beginners
I would also like to list some programmes which Beginners should implement.
1. Create a program where user inputs 2 int values in 2 input boxes and you display the greatest of them on the alert box, when a button is clicked.
2. Create a program where user enters a number in a text box and you should display its table (upto 10) on a div. The table should be created on the button click event. Also prevent user to enter string on the text box (give appropriate error on alert box when input is string).
3. Create a small form for Job Application. It should have 5 fields – name, age, education, address and expected salary. These 5 fields should have HTML controls where user enter his/her information, there should be a button which on clicking shown the user information on a div controls.

What should be covered on the Advanced level of JavaScript
When you are on the Advanced level, this means you basically know how to work on JavaScript. In the Advanced level you have to deal with integration of JavaScript with applications created on Python, Ruby, PHP, ASP NET etc.
Here your job would be to make features on JavaScript that communicate efficiently with the Server technology like databases, Python, Ruby, PHP, ASP.NET Core, etc
Some examples of advanced features made with JavaScript are:
1. Partially updating parts of a web page from database every few seconds using AJAX.
2. Get and show real time stock prices on the page. You can get the stock price by implementing the API with your JavaScript code.
3. Creating interactive feature in your website so that conversion rates increases. Example can be an autocomplete feature which you can create with JavaSript.
4. External API implementations like TMDB API in your JavaScript and helping users to get details of any movie, actor & series
5. Infinite scroll or auto-paging feature
Conclusion
I only want to point you in the right directly so that you can learn JavaScript efficiently and at the same time you also love this web language.
You will need a good patience to learn JavaScript just like this guy:
